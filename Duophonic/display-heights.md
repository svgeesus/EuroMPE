# Screen, button, encoder heights

Needs a test panel to check assembly of encoder, buttons, panel (on daughterboard).

## Screen

1.67mm pcb
**3.16mm** pcb+screen => 1.49mm screen thickness

**4.33mm** pcb+edge connector insulation => 2.66mm connector (excluding pins)

total height 4.33 + 3.16 - 1.67 = **5.82mm**
so needs -5.86 + 8.6 = **2.74mm** lift.
Long pin connector?
