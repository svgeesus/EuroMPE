# Power, Jacks and Trimmers

For space and stability considerations, the power circuitry will be in the unused gap between the [perf dac](./performance-dac.md) jacks and the trimmers. Also, a pair of standoffs will better support the trimmers which do not screw to the panel.

## Board dimensions

width="56" height="51.8"

Jacks have 13mm center-to-center vertical spacing and are 12.5mm tall.

Looks like the current DAC-to-jack connectors will foul some of the jacks. May need to re-layout the [Perf DAC board](./performance-dac.md).
