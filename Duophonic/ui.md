# User Interface

Goal is that normal operation does not involve interacting with screen or buttons.

They are instead used for:

- Calibration and Tuning
  - Starting auto-tune
  - Setting MIDI Note corresponding to 0V
  - Setting tuning of A4 (440Hz default)
- Configuration
  - MPE/nonMPE mode?
  - MIDI channel selection (if non-MPE)
  - Global CC/NRPN configuration

## Screen

Monochrome OLED, 128x32 pixels 0.91 inch diagonal.

## Encoder

Rotary encoder for menu scrolling, with integrated switch for "accept".

## Buttons

1. Back/Escape
2. Tune
3. Config
4. Run (normal operation)
