# Calibration

There are two types of calibration:

## Initial setup trimming

Ensure trimmers are on front panel so unit can be trimmed while in the rack, powered and warm. Firstly setting precise 5V output from reference; then setting offset (by adjusting the 2V offset reference) and gain on output of each pitch DAC.

The 14bit performance outputs are untrimmed, 0-5V within 5-10mV is fine.

Vref needs extensive trimming and measurement (for ageing) outside case anyway. Provide a buffered +5V jack on front panel, offset trimmer near it. Maybe provide a kelvin output for 5V (4 pin mini XLR) and display case and Vref temps on the display.

Needs outputs at 0V (before offset, so provide test point? or trim outside case as a first check), -2V (= 0V after offset, for offset trim), -4.8 = -2.8V, +4.8 = +6.8V (to avoid DAC extremes where zero and FS offset complicate gain setting, for gain trim).

Global pitch offset also needs an output, for calibration, plus handy to expose for other patching.

This could use an entirely separate program on the T3.6, compared to the normal one, if it only needs to be done once. Might be better to allow re-calibration after drift though (annual maintenance).

## Per-voice oscillator calibration (tuning)

Avoid non-linear calibration curves. These are fine for pulling poorly-tracking oscillators into tune but then the same errors affect the other modules using pitch (filters etc). Instead go for high linearity, and use with well tracking oscillators.

Two stages: coarse tune (manual oscilator tning to a fixed pitch) then fine tune (measuring frequency per-oscillator at a range of voltages, for linearity and for oscillator range). Could explore osc range using secondary pitch output, giving (with Â±3V offsets) -6V (-# and -3) to +10V (+7 and +3) = 16 octaves.

Output the same voltage (frequency calculated for the given CV, e.g. for 440Hz) on all pitch channels. Also a sine output from one of the T3.6 DACs, e.g. 440Hz, for beat frequency tuning). Use FreqMeasure library to provide a frequency input, showing the frequency on the LCD screen. This allows each oscilator to be tuned the same. These pins support measuring frequency:
