# L-1 Basic VCO evaluation

Un-adjusted L-1 Basic VCO, as built, trimmers as found.
CV to V/Oct input, and to front panel jacks on 34465A.
Tri out to rear jacks on 34465A.

Synt PSU monitored with Joranalogue Test3, rails steady at +12.02V -12.06V.
Current draw of the L-1 BVCO 34mA @ +12, 36mA @ -12.

## Volts per octave slope

Two-point slope evaluation at 0V and 5V.

Pitch CV from Ian Johnston PDVS2, s/n 00120. Voltage measured on Keysight 34465A, DCV, 100PLC, HiZ.

Frequency measured on Keysight 34465A, >20Hz filter, 1s gate time.

L-1 basic VCO set to close to 32Hz  at 0V with coarse and fine controls.
Tweaked as close as possible to 32Hz (32.00216Hz) with offset on PDVS2 (2.7mV)

Set to 5V, then voltage adjusted until freq was 5 octaves above 32Hz, 1024Hz (1024.137Hz) which was at 4.9883V

4.9856 / 5 = 0.99712 volts per octave

## Frequency drift

At 32Hz, steady downward drift from 32.00216 to 31.71771 Hz over 30 minutes (3.15%)

At 1024Hz, instability plus downward drift from 1024.221Hz to 1022.150Hz over 30 min (0.20%).

## Tuning

PDVS2 set to alternate between 0.00000V (actual 0.00001V) and 5.00000V (actual 4.99995V).

Out of the case, variability increased (sensitivity to drafts? Temperature?)

0.0030V 32.09232Hz sd 64mHz
5.0030V 1041.488Hz sd 447mHz
