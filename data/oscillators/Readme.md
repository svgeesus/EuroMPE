# Oscillators

A study of the tuning accuracy and stability of several analog voltage controlled oscillators.

## Materials & Methods

* Keysight 34465A 6.5 digit bench multimeter
  * instrument ID 869657

  * Cal type: Accredited 17025 with uncertainties
  * Cal temp: 23.0C
  * Cal humidity: 23.0% RH

## Notes

Expo converters will have their own errors, so will not give a perfect curve

Oscillators may display self-heating, especially at higher frequencies where currents through the expo converter are higher

Oscillators which use a voltage rail or a voltage regulator as a voltage reference will display very poor line regulations, which will manifest as stability drift over time.
